Log file contains entries like user A visited page 1, user B visited page 3, user C visited page 2, user D visited page no 4 . How will you implement a Hadoop job for this to answer the following queries in real-time –   Which page was visited by user C more than 4 times in a day and Which page was visited by only one user exactly 3 times in a day?

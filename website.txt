Dataset:

URL         USER        TIMESTAMP
yahoo.com      A    2017-01-01 01:12:13
google.com     B    2017-01-01 02:12:13
dezyre.com     C    2017-01-01 03:12:13

Question -  Log file contains entries like user A visited page 1, user B visited page 3, user C visited page 2, user D visited page no 4 . How will you implement a Hadoop job for this to answer the following queries in real-time –   Which page was visited by user C more than 4 times in a day and Which page was visited by only one user exactly 3 times in a day?

Answer:
CREATE  EXTERNAL TABLE website_demo_data
(urls varchar(255),
users varchar(20),
visit_time TIMESTAMP
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY "\t"
LINES TERMINATED BY "\n"
LOCATION "hdfs://dezyrecluster/dezyre"

Which page was visited by user C more than 4 times in a day?

SELECT urls, day(visit_time) AS day_date, count(*) AS n_of_visits
FROM website_demo_data
WHERE users = 'C'
GROUP BY urls, day(visit_time)
HAVING count(*) > 4;

Which page was visited by only one user exactly 3 times in a day?

SELECT a.urls, day(a.visit_time) AS day_date, count(*) AS n_of_visits
FROM website_demo_data a
JOIN
(SELECT urls, COUNT(DISTINCT users) distinct_users
FROM website_demo_data
GROUP BY urls
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT users) = 1) b
ON a.urls = b.urls
GROUP BY a.urls, day(a.visit_time)
HAVING COUNT(*) = 3;
